For build.sh to run properly, the following prerequisites must be met.

1. Install Node.js, Node Package Manager, and PhantomJS using the package manager of your choice.
   $ sudo apt-get install nodejs npm phantomjs

2. Install JSLint using the Node Package Manager.
   $ sudo npm install jslint

3. Open /usr/local/lib/node_modules/jslint/bin/jslint.js.
   Change line 1 to 
      #! /usr/bin/env nodejs

build.sh also depends on the Closure Compiler and run-jasmine.js, both of which are included in the repository. If these need to be downloaded again, do the following.

4. Download compiler-20130823.tar.gz from https://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/downloads/list

5. Download run-jasmine.js from https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/blob/master/examples/run-jasmine.js.

6. Open run-jasmine.js.
   Change lines 53 and 54 to
      console.log("Could not access " + system.args[1]);
      phantom.exit(1);
